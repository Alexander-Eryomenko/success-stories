                <p>“I linked up with Stan McQuay in the fall of 2013.
                    At this point I had some small successes and wins in powerlifting and I placed well in a few
                    bodybuilding
                    shows but had yet to win one.
                    Since linking up with Stan I have had 4 class wins, 1 overall win, and brought my best physique to
                    the
                    USA
                    stage...
                    Stan has been that guy in that he respects my desire to be very hands on with my prep and that I
                    will
                    probably annoy him with wanting to know "why" we do certain things...instead of just asking what to
                    do.
                    I couldn't be happier being part of Physique Inc and I look forward to continue learning from Stan
                    and
                    all
                    the other people on the coaching staff!”
